# IP address tracker

This is a solution to[ the IP address tracker](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0) challenge on Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

Built with :

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS ](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

## What I learned

In this project I worked with two APIs. One to get the geographical location and the other to render the map. The interactions between the two were fascinating and challenging for me. There were also challenges to responsive the app that I did with Tailwind

## Feedback

Please do not forget to leave me your feedback by taking a look at the code and if you did not understand something let me know as it is always good to be improving.
